        <h2>Basics 1: Light</h2>
        <p>Ideally, the most realistic way to render a scene would be to simulate the motion of each individual photon in the scene. However, this isn't feasible. An ideal 60-watt lightbulb emits an enormous amount of photons, on the order of 10<sup>20</sup> photons. If you were to simulate all of those photons, the scene would take a stupidly long time to render.</p>

        <p>The biggest issue is that the vast majority of the photons in the scene never interact with the camera. There's a simple solution: start from the camera. This way, only light rays that ultimately contribute to the image will be considered. This brings us to our camera model.</p>
