            <h1 class="center">Fish and Pianos</h1>
            
            <p>You can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish... or can you?</p>
            <p>This article isn't about fish. Rather, it's about piano tuning and its paradoxical nature. Due to the way the Western 12-tone system works, it's actually mathematically impossible to tune a piano.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Why?</h2>
            <p>First, let's take a moment to understand what it means to be in tune. To do that, we'll have to take a look at how our brain perceives harmony.</p>

            <p>When you pick a string, it will emit a sound with a frequency proportional to the tension of the string (among other factors). This is called the fundamental frequency of the string. However, due to the imperfect nature of real life, it will also emit many weaker overtones. The frequencies of these overtones are always whole-number multiples of the fundamental.</p>

            <p>For example, when you pluck a string with a fundamental frequency of 440 Hz, it will also produce overtones at 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, and so on. Each overtone gets progressively weaker. This pattern is called the harmonic series, and our brain happens to like it when these overtones are played together because they line up nicely.</p>

            <p>These tones sound so good together that we've given names to the intervals between each successive tone.</p>

            <p>There are names for the other ones, but they're not as important to this article.</p>

            <h2 class="center">What's the Problem?</h2>

            <p>There are  6whole steps in an octave. If we multiply the fundamental by 9:8 seven times, we should get the note exactly one octave above it. So let's try it out.</p>

            <p>`(9/8)^6 = 2.28069735`</p>

            <p><b>That's not right! What gives?</b> you might be asking.</p>
            
            <p>Actually, there are no whole-number fractions that can multiply into 2. Invariably, any rational interval (in the mathematical sense) comes back to the same problem.</p>
            
            <h2 class="center">The Sort-Of Solution</h2>
            <p>Instead of the naive tuning system we introduced in the previous section, most pianos are tuned using a system called <b>equal temperament</b>.</p>

            <p>Equal temperament tunes in half-steps. The ratio for each half-step is fixed at the 12th root of 2, roughly 1.0595. When you raise this value to the 12th power, it is mathematically equal to exactly 2.</p>

            <p>This system doesn't get progressively out of tune as you go up; rather, every note is <i>slightly</i> out of tune, but acceptably so for most purposes. For instance, let's look at some intervals.</p>

            <table style="border: 1px solid;">
                <tr>
                    <th>Interval</th>
                    <th>Semitones</th>
                    <th>Actual Ratio</th>
                    <th>Equal Temperament Ratio</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Octave</td>
                    <td>12</td>
                    <td>2 (2:1)</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Perfect Fifth</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                    <td>1.5 (3:2)</td>
                    <td>1.498</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Perfect Fourth</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>1.33... (4:3)</td>
                    <td>1.335</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Major Third</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>1.25 (5:4)</td>
                    <td>1.260</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>As you can see, the equal temperament intervals come quite close, but none except the octave are perfectly in tune. Even small differences can adversely affect the resonant qualities of intervals played in equal temperament, though, which is why some people (especially string players) advocate for other tuning systems..</p>

            <h2 class="center">Closing Remarks</h2>

            <p>As you look further into tuning systems, you'll quickly realize that there is nothing but pain in the barren confluence between mathematics and music. Don't think about it too much. There is no golden mean, only approximations of what can never be.</p>
