            <h1 class="center">Fish and Pianos</h1>
            
            <p>You can't tuna fish, but you can tune a piano... or can you?</p>
            <p>This article isn't about puns. Rather, it's about piano tuning and its paradoxical nature. Due to the way the Western 12-tone system works, it's actually mathematically impossible to tune a piano.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Why?</h2>
            <p>First, let's take a moment to understand what it means to be in tune. To do that, we'll have to take a look at how our brain perceives harmony.</p>

            <p>When you pick a string, the string vibrates. This mechanical vibration transfers its energy to the air. Your ear can sense these vibrations in the air.</p>

            <p>A few qualities of this vibration determine what we perceive it as.
                
            <p>Armed with this newfound knowledge, we can now rephrase the original statement in a way that will help us understand the issue with tuning down the road. When a string is plucked, it will emit a sound with a frequency proportional to the tension of the string. This is called the fundamental frequency of the string. However, due to the imperfect nature of real life, it will also emit many weaker overtones. The frequencies of these overtones are always whole-number multiples of the fundamental.</p>

            <p>For example, when you pluck a string with a fundamental frequency of 440 Hz, it will also produce overtones at 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, and so on. Each overtone gets progressively weaker. This pattern is called the harmonic series, and our brain happens to like it when these overtones are played together because they line up nicely.</p>

            <p>Using a fancy mathematical tool called the Fourier transform, a sound's waveform can be broken apart into many fundamental tones which when put back together recreate the original waveform. It's sometimes useful to visualize the distribution of these tones using a graph. This string played in this graph was a low E (82 Hz), but you can see spikes at each whole-number multiple of the fundamental frequency. Each spike represents an overtone.</p>

            <p>These overtones sound so good together that we've given names to the intervals between each successive tone.</p>

            <p>There are names for the other ones, but we can make do with just these few for the sake of this article.</p>

            <h2 class="center">What's the Problem?</h2>

            <p>There are 6 whole steps in an octave. If we move 6 whole steps up from the root note, we should have traveled a distance equivalent to one octave. In terms of frequency, this means multiplying the fundamental by 9:8 six times. So let's try it out.</p>

            <p>`(9/8)^6 = 2.02728653`</p>
            <p>`(9/8) != 2`</p>

            <p><b>That's not right! What gives?</b></p>
            
            <p>Actually, there are <b>no whole-number fractions</b> whose product is 2. Invariably, any rational interval (in the mathematical sense) comes back to the same problem.</p>
            
            <h2 class="center">The Sort-Of Solution</h2>
            <p>Instead of the naive tuning system we introduced in the previous section, most pianos are tuned using a system called <b>equal temperament</b>.</p>

            <p>Equal temperament tunes in half-steps. The ratio for each half-step is fixed at the 12th root of 2, roughly 1.0595. When you raise this value to the 12th power, it will be equal to exactly 2 <i>by definition</i>.</p>

            <p>This system doesn't get progressively out of tune as you go up; rather, every note is <i>slightly</i> out of tune, but acceptably so for most purposes. For instance, let's look at some intervals.</p>

            <table style="border: 1px solid;">
                <tr>
                    <th>Interval</th>
                    <th>Semitones</th>
                    <th>Actual Ratio</th>
                    <th>Equal Temperament Ratio</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Octave</td>
                    <td>12</td>
                    <td>2 (2:1)</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Perfect Fifth</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                    <td>1.5 (3:2)</td>
                    <td>~1.498</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Perfect Fourth</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>1.33... (4:3)</td>
                    <td>~1.335</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Major Third</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>1.25 (5:4)</td>
                    <td>~1.260</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>As you can see, the equal temperament intervals come quite close, but none except the octave are perfectly in tune. Even small differences can adversely affect the resonant qualities of intervals played in equal temperament, though, which is why some people (especially string players) advocate for other tuning systems.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Closing Remarks</h2>

            <p>As you look further into tuning systems, you'll quickly realize that there is nothing but pain in the barren confluence between mathematics and music. Don't think about it too much. There is no golden mean, only approximations of what can never be.</p>
